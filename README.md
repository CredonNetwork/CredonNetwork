Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I chose my Module 3-3 Project One project. It was a program that was intended as an interview audition to prove that I, the interviewee, knew how to write code ass needed for the job. The coded program was expected to read program/user input data and convert it in a dual clock program. One clock was for a 12-hour clock, another was for a 24 hour clock.

Q. What did you do particularly well?

A. I think I did very well with my clock class operator.

 
Q. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

A. Two things. One, I wish I had setup ELSE branches for my IF ELSE statements in case my code wasn't perfect. Two, I wish that I had used 'using namespace std', due to it being simpler to read. However, I was trying to practice without it to avoid 'potential name collisions'.

Q. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

A. I found my void processinput statement to be the most difficult part of configuring my code. I had decided to type my code without using 'using namespace std' and that paired with the complexities of correctly coding my processinput statements made it extremely tricky. I wish that I had simplified it for myself, though I'm glad that I got the practice of not using it... for the experience.


Q. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

A. This first project really tested me because it put many of the first tools that I'd learned to use. I used this experience and built on it with the additional assignments and projects.


Q. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

A. I write a lot of notes from ZyBooks and use GeeksforGeeks.net for any questions about something I have questions about. I also use a combination of trial and error and the SENSE program. SENSE has been a lifesaver in both my Python and JAVAScript classes, and it was a lifesaver in Project One and Project Two of this C++ course. I really wish that I'd had it to test my Project Three codes. 


Thank you for your time.
